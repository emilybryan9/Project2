<h1>Michael Jackson</h1>
<div class="text">
<p class="top">
Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and the robot. His sound and style have influenced artists of various genres, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture.

<h3>Early Life</h3>
Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. Jackson began his career when he was seven years old as the lead singer of the Jackson 5, breaking into stardom in 1969 after signing into Motown. The Jackson 5’s first four singles all peaked at number one on the Billboard 100, and soon after Michael pursued a solo career.

A talented, outgoing child, he dazzled in the spotlight as part of the Jackson 5. By the early 1970s, Jackson was a fresh-faced teen fronting a Motown-signed family musical group who had their own television series, a Saturday morning cartoon and recorded hits such as “I Want You Back” and “I’ll Be There.”

<h3 class="middle">Have You Seen My Childhood?</h3>    
Jackson had a successful career before he was of high-school age, but it came at the cost of his childhood.

“I never had the chance to do the fun things kids do,” Jackson once said of his early life. As an adult, Jackson created a haven in Neverland Ranch, an amusement park-like California home named after a location from the tales of the fictional character Peter Pan. Pan was a boy who could fly and never grows up. “I totally identify with Peter Pan, the lost boy from Never Neverland,” Jackson said.

Jackson’s father, Joe, recognized the talent in his children and pushed them toward a musical career. He was unrelenting in the early years, telling Time magazine in 1984 that he rehearsed them “every day, for at least two or three hours… They got a little upset about the whole thing in the beginning because the other kids were out having a good time.” Jackson accused his father of being physically abusive. “We’d perform for him, and he’d critique us,” Jackson wrote in Moonwalk, his 1988 autobiography. “If you messed up, you got hit, sometimes with a belt, sometimes with a switch.”

Insulated from others his age, Jackson spent his formative years either in the spotlight or rehearsing for it, not indulging in the regular activities of an everyday kid. Success followed, as did greater fame and more money. His solo album Off the Wall was a sensation and the follow-up, Thriller, became the bestselling album of 1983, earning eight Grammy Awards.

Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" because he transformed the art of music videos and paved the way for modern pop music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger generation. His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs. Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, shaping the channel into a form that proved enduring. In songs such as "Man in the Mirror", "Black or White", Heal the World, "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested injustice. He is recognized as the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records. He is considered one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, and his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.
